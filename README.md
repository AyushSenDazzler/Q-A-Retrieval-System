# üéà Ollama PDF-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Streamlit

This **Streamlit** application enables you to upload PDF documents, process them into vector embeddings, and interact with the content through a question-answering interface powered by **Ollama‚Äôs Llama 3** language models. The system uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques to generate answers based on context derived from the uploaded PDF document.

With this tool, users can seamlessly:
- Upload PDFs
- Extract vector-based information
- Query the document‚Äôs content in a conversational format

## üöÄ Features

- **Upload PDFs**: Easily upload PDF files for processing and retrieval.
- **Vector Database**: Automatically splits the PDF into chunks, embeds them, and stores them in a **Chroma** vector store for fast querying.
- **Model Selection**: Choose from available local models powered by **Ollama**.
- **Query-Based Interactions**: Ask questions based on the document‚Äôs content, and get context-aware responses.
- **PDF Viewer**: View all PDF pages as images with a zoom feature.
- **Delete Vector Database**: Option to delete the vector database and reset the app.
- **Customizable Zoom**: Adjust the zoom level to view PDF content clearly.
- **Streamlit UI**: A user-friendly web interface built with **Streamlit**.
